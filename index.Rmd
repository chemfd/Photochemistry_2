# Welcome {-}

The notes have been prepared in a package called BookDown for RStudio so that the equations are accessible to screen readers. However, by providing the notes as a .html webpage I have also been able to embed short concept bite videos to further describe some of the topics. Further you can access the notes in a format that suits you:

- download the notes (top bar on the screen) (either pdf or epub) to view offline (videos will not download).
- or change the way this document appears for ease of reading (A button in toolbar), changing the font, font size and background colour.

The document is also searchable (magnifying glass in header bar) and you can access or remove the navigation list by clicking on the four horizontal lines in the header bar.

This is a relatively new format of the document and is easily editable, therefore if you do find any typing errors, areas with lack of clarity, or other errors please let me know. I will update the document accordingly and update the version history below. If there are any major changes I will inform you as a class. I can and will also address areas where you feel there isn't enough detail, just use the same form below.

## Additional Resources {#sec:AddnRes}

Whilst this resource is designed to stand alone, you will find it beneficial to read around the subject or else listen to the concept bites. I refer to the book by Wardle frequently and you have access to it digitally *via* the library, although there are a number of excellent photochemistry textbooks which I've listed below.
