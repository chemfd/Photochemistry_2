# Welcome {-}

The notes have been prepared in a package called BookDown for RStudio so that the equations are accessible to screen readers. However, by providing the notes as a .html webpage I have also been able to embed short concept bite videos to further describe some of the topics. Further you can download the notes (top left of the screen) in a format that suits you (either pdf or epub) to view offline, or change the way this document appears for ease of reading.

This is a new format of the document for this year and is easily editable, therefore if you do find any typing errors, areas with lack of clarity, or other errors please let me know. I will update the document accordingly and update the version history below. If there are any major changes I will inform you as a class.

## Additional Resources {#sec:AddnRes}

Whilst this resource is designed to stand alone, you may find it beneficial to read around the subject or else listen to the concept bites. I refer to the book by Wardle frequently and you have access to it digitally via the library, although there are a number of excellent photochemistry textbooks. If you want more details about other books please contact me.

## Report errors

If you spot any errors or areas of lack of clarity, please message me in Teams or preferably report on the error log below:
