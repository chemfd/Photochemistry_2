# Index

The notes have been prepared in a package called BookDown for RStudio so that the equations are accessible to screen readers. However, by providing the notes as a .html webpage I have also been able to embed short concept bite videos to further describe some of the topics and you can download the notes (top left of the screen) in a format that suits you to view offline.

The initial commit of this book is dated 6th September 2020.
